Hi, I’m Rajiv Abraham Nela.

![alt text] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/a67q56h529fr546/RajivAbrahamNela.jpg?raw=1 "Rajiv Abraham Nela")

I’m an investor and geek from India. I love to introduce myself as Abraham, Christian… just doesn’t have the same ring to it as Bond, James Bond.

For years I worked as a manager and trainer in the corporate world including the world’s local bank.

Then I discovered I couldn’t do the same for life, not if it meant working 15+ hours daily and most weekends.

That made the decision for me to go into business on my own which I did successfully in e-commerce and copywriting.

Unfortunately, the long work hours did not end though, I simply began to work 15+ hours from home.

After a period of prayerful reflection and introspection, I decided that I needed to work on something that did not involve a lot of work, and hence my introduction into the world of investing and trading.

By now this should highlight the fact that learning new skills comes easy to me.

I’m a geek by nature, I like to learn new things, love to tinker with new stuff, and I am mostly self-taught from basic HTML and CSS to various projects on the Raspberry Pi including home automation.

I also like to write and blog, I began to personally blog around 2004, and possibly also a throwback to my days as a copywriter, or an inherent need to express myself creatively.

For the most part though I do what I want, even if it is something as unexciting as binge-watching shows on Netflix. I am a stay at home husband, and an avid audiophile and videophile. I learn new things like photography, coding on the Raspberry Pi, and home automation with Alexa and Google Home. I also study copywriting and marketing especially in relation to conversions and human psychology and behavior, again a throwback to my days of investment banking, and then going into business on my own in e-commerce.

Mostly though, I am a full-on Christian who is sold on the Lord Jesus Christ for eternity. You can say obeying Him is my calling in life.

PS: This is a work in progress because I am a work in progress.
