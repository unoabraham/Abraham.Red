I don’t blog that often (though I’m trying to change that).

At the outset, let me warn you that I write about my “experiences”. For the most part, I share my personal experiences and also what I have learned from my experiences.

I blog/microblog/post status updates at [Abraham’s Microblog] (https://abraham.uno/ "Abraham’s Microblog").

I linkblog at [Abraham’s Linkblog] (https://abraham.link/ "Abraham’s Linkblog").

I photoblog at [Abraham’s Photoblog] (https://abraham.gallery/ "Abraham’s Photoblog").

I also microblog at [@unoabraham] (https://micro.blog/unoabraham).

I hope to see you there.
